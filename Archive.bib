  abstract = {The tight focus of Gaussian beams is commonly used to trap dielectric
	particles in optical tweezers. The corresponding field distribution
	generates a well-defined trapping potential that is only marginally
	controllable on a nanometre scale. Here we investigate the influence
	of a metal nanostructure that is located in the vicinity of the trapping
	focus on the trapping potential by calculating the corresponding
	field and force distributions. Even for an excitation wavelength
	that is tuned far from the plasmonic resonance of the nanostructure,
	the presence of the latter alters significantly the trap potential.
	For the given nanostructure, a ring of spheres that is illuminated
	in the axial direction, a smaller focus volume is observed in comparison
	to free focus. The superposition of this non-resonant Gaussian field
	with a planar wave illumination that is tuned to the plasmonic resonance
	gives a handle to modify the trapping potential. Polarization and
	intensity of the resonant illumination allows modifying the equilibrium
	position of the trapping potential, thus providing means to steer
	dielectric particles with nanometre precision.},

  abstract = {Over the years extensive studies have been carried out to apply coherent
	optics methods in real-time communications and image transmission.
	This is especially true when a large amount of information needs
	to be processed, e.g., in high-resolution imaging. The recent progress
	in data-processing networks and communication systems has considerably
	increased the capacity of information exchange. However, the transmitted
	data can be intercepted by nonauthorized people. This explains why
	considerable effort is being devoted at the current time to data
	encryption and secure transmission. In addition, only a small part
	of the overall information is really useful for many applications.
	Consequently, applications can tolerate information compression that
	requires important processing when the transmission bit rate is taken
	into account. To enable efficient and secure information exchange,
	it is often necessary to reduce the amount of transmitted information.
	In this context, much work has been undertaken using the principle
	of coherent optics filtering for selecting relevant information and
	encrypting it. Compression and encryption operations are often carried
	out separately, although they are strongly related and can influence
	each other. Optical processing methodologies, based on filtering,
	are described that are applicable to transmission and/or data storage.
	Finally, the advantages and limitations of a set of optical compression
	and encryption methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {This tutorial gives an overview of the use of the Wigner function
	as a tool for modeling optical field propagation. Particular emphasis
	is placed on the spatial propagation of stationary fields, as well
	as on the propagation of pulses through dispersive media. In the
	first case, the Wigner function gives a representation of the field
	that is similar to a radiance or weight distribution for all the
	rays in the system, since its arguments are both position and direction.
	In cases in which the field is paraxial and where the system is described
	by a simple linear relation in the ray regime, the Wigner function
	is constant under propagation along rays. An equivalent property
	holds for optical pulse propagation in dispersive media under analogous
	assumptions. Several properties and applications of the Wigner function
	in these contexts are discussed, as is its connection with other
	common phase-space distributions like the ambiguity function, the
	spectrogram, and the Husimi, P, Q, and Kirkwood\&\#8211;Rihaczek

  abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in the fields of quantum information
	processing and quantum technologies is the detailed coherent control
	over each and every constituent of quantum systems with an ever increasing
	number of particles. Within this endeavor, harnessing of many-body
	entanglement against the detrimental effects of the environment is
	a major pressing issue. Besides being an important concept from a
	fundamental standpoint, entanglement has been recognized as a crucial
	resource for quantum speed-ups or performance enhancements over classical
	methods. Understanding and controlling many-body entanglement in
	open systems may have strong implications in quantum computing, quantum
	simulations of many-body systems, secure quantum communication or
	cryptography, quantum metrology, our understanding of the quantum-to-classical
	transition, and other important questions of quantum foundations.
	In this paper we present an overview of recent theoretical and experimental
	efforts to underpin the dynamics of entanglement under the influence
	of noise. Entanglement is thus taken as a dynamic quantity on its
	own, and we survey how it evolves due to the unavoidable interaction
	of the entangled system with its surroundings. We analyze several
	scenarios, corresponding to different families of states and environments,
	which render a very rich diversity of dynamical behaviors. In contrast
	to single-particle quantities, like populations and coherences, which
	typically vanish only asymptotically in time, entanglement may disappear
	at a finite time. In addition, important classes of entanglement
	display an exponential decay with the number of particles when subject
	to local noise, which poses yet another threat to the already-challenging
	scaling of quantum technologies. Other classes, however, turn out
	to be extremely robust against local noise. Theoretical results and
	recent experiments regarding the difference between local and global
	decoherence are summarized. Control and robustness-enhancement techniques,
	scaling laws, statistical and geometrical aspects of multipartite-entanglement
	decay are also reviewed; all in order to give a broad picture of
	entanglement dynamics in open quantum systems addressed to both theorists

	the perturbation of the coupling coefficients through their derivatives
	with respect to geometric characteristics of the rods of the photonic
	crystal lattice. Once these derivatives are calculated, it becomes
	possible to estimate the transfer functions of a large number of
	randomly perturbed devices at a small additional computational cost.
	This enables the statistical study of many performance issues of
	CROWs, such as the amplitude and position of the device's resonances.
	The model can be used to study the influence of imperfections of
	different strengths and types on CROWs of various lengths.},

	are studied theoretically. It is shown that their form is determined
	by the competition between collective superradiant mode formation
	and inhomogeneous broadening. A random sources method is used to
	calculate the photoluminescence spectra from an nonresonant pumped
	microcavity, and a standard diagram technique is used to provide
	a microscopic justification for the random sources method. The emission
	spectra of a microcavity are analyzed taking into account the spread
	of exciton energy due to inhomogeneous distribution of quantum dots
	and tunneling between them. It is demonstrated that the luminescence
	spectra of strongly tunnel-coupled quantum dots are sensitive to
	the dot positions, and the collective mode can (under certain conditions)
	be stabilized by random tunneling links. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, I explore interactions between matter and propagating
	light. The electromagnetic field is modeled as a reservoir of quantum
	harmonic oscillators successively streaming past a quantum system.
	Each weak and fleeting interaction entangles the light and the system,
	and the light continues its course. Within the framework of open
	quantum systems, the light is eventually traced out, leaving the
	reduced quantum state of the system as the primary mathematical subject.
	Two major results are presented. The first is a master equation approach
	for a quantum system interacting with a traveling wave packet prepared
	with a definite number of photons. In contrast to quasi-classical
	states, such as coherent or thermal fields, these N-photon states
	possess temporal mode entanglement, and local interactions in time
	have nonlocal consequences. The second is a model for a three-dimensional
	light-matter interface for an atomic ensemble interacting with a
	paraxial laser beam and its application to the generation of QND
	spin squeezing. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics due to spatially
	inhomogeneous atom-light coupling across the ensemble are accounted
	for. Measurement of paraxially scattered light can generate squeezing
	of an atomic spin wave, while diffusely scattered photons lead to
	spatially local decoherence.},

	the optical analogue of double Fano resonance. The photonic system
	is configured so that it causes simultaneous cross coupling between
	two decay channels via one array and another two decay channels via
	the other array. Owing to the two individual interference effects,
	the decay-rate profile for the waveguide coupled directly to the
	continuum exhibits two asymmetric peaks, or dips, or a combination
	of one peak and one dip in the vicinity of the frequency mismatches.
	As far as the distribution of optical field amplitudes in the side-coupled
	waveguides is concerned, the present model also demonstrates the
	features of optical trapping (optical analogue of coherent population
	trapping) in side-coupled waveguides under certain symmetric parametric
	conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Consider a bipartite quantum system with at least one of
	its two components being itself a composite system. By tracing over
	part of one (or both) of these two subsystems it is possible to obtain
	a reduced (separable) state that exhibits quantum correlations even
	if the original state of the full system is endowed only with classical
	correlations. This effect, first pointed out by Li and Luo in (2008),
	is of considerable interest because there is a growing body of evidence
	suggesting that quantum correlations in non-entangled, mixed states
	may constitute a useful resource to implement non trivial information
	related tasks. Here we conduct a systematic exploration of the aforementioned
	effect for particular families of states of quantum systems of low
	dimensionality (three qubits states). In order to assess the non-classicality
	of the correlations of the reduced states we use an indicator of
	quantum correlations based upon the state disturbances generated
	by the measurement of local observables. We show, for a three-qubit
	system, that there exists a relationship between the classical mutual
	information of the original classically correlated states and the
	maximum quantum correlation exhibited by the reduced states. },

  abstract = {Abstract Microcavities can be used to control the spectral properties
	of ensembles of quantum dots. In this work, spherical microcavities
	with quality (Q) factors as high as 3 ×�?108 in air were coated with
	a layer of fluorescent silicon quantum dots. After coating, the transmission
	Q factors decreased to approximately 106 or slightly lower, while
	the luminescence Q-factors (QPL) reached a maximum of �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????000.
	While these are the highest QPL values yet reported for Si QDs, QPL
	was always orders of magnitude lower than the intrinsic cavity Q.
	One reason for the difference has its origin in the quantum dot emission
	linewidth, which is associated only with the QPL and not with the
	cold cavity (intrinsic) Q. Essentially, the Q factor in luminescence
	experiments arises from the spontaneous emission rate enhancements
	or suppressions experienced by the dot in the cavity. We developed
	a general model to calculate the luminescence spectrum and decay
	dynamics for an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of quantum dots
	with arbitrary emission linewidths weakly coupled to an optical cavity.
	Using this model and comparing it with experiment, we show that the
	respective values of the luminescence quality factors and the cold
	cavity quality factors can be used to determine an effective quantum
	dot emission linewidth without the need for single particle spectroscopy.
	In the case of Si quantum dots, the room temperature emission linewidth
	may be as small as a few meV at room temperature.},

	optical waveguides (CROWs) composed of side-coupled whispering gallery
	(WG) mode microdisks are performed. Pre- and post-fabrication tuning
	capability of the designed structures is explored, and a novel concept
	of realization of tunable CROW-based routers and switches is introduced.
	The proposed tuning mechanism exploits the properties of CROW optical
	modes coupling with avoided crossing scenario rather than the previously
	used Vernier effect. Applications of spectrally-engineered branched
	CROW structures for controllable manipulation of coupling between
	spatially separated nano-emitters are also discussed.},

	data transmission using four angular momentum modes at a single wavelength,
	and 1.6 terabits per second using two OAM modes over 10 wavelengths.
	These demonstrations suggest that OAM could provide an additional

  year = {1979},
  volume = {52},
  pages = {133},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The microscopic and the macroscopic (phenomenological) approach to
	the electromagnetic theory in matter can be looked upon as complementary
	to each other. In view of the complexity of the deductive microscopic
	approach it is desirable to use experimental information to test
	the predictions of the more simple macroscopic theory. The purpose
	of the present paper is to review and give the theory of experiments
	and Gedanken experiments in relation to various expressions for the
	electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor. The paper is divided into
	three parts. The first part discusses the electrostriction effect,
	mainly in electrostatic experiments. It turns out that both the Hakim-Higham
	experiment (1962) and the Goetz-Zahn experiment (1958) agree with
	the predictions of the Helmholtz theory and disagree with the predictions
	of the Einstein-Laub theory. The second part of the paper is concerned
	with quasi-stationary crossed electric and magnetic fields. The electrostriction
	effect is here unimportant. Both the experiment of Walker et al.
	(1975) and that of James (1968) support the Abraham tensor in contradiction
	to the Minkowski tensor. The third and most extensive part of the
	paper discusses optical phenomena, in which case a direct observation
	of the fluctuating Abraham force cannot be made. Under usual circumstances,
	it turns out to be simplest to use the divergence-free Minkowski
	tensor. This tensor describes satisfactorily all existing force or
	torque experiments in optics that we are aware of. Some attention
	is given also to the tensor alternative recently introduced by Peierls
	(1976).},

  abstract = {A promising approach to merge atomic systems with scalable photonics
	has emerged recently, which consists of trapping cold atoms near
	tapered nanofibers. Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve
	strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such
	a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects,
	which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-finesse cavity within
	the fiber. We show that a specially designated ‘impurity�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????atom
	within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with
	single photons in the fiber. Under realistic conditions, a ‘strong
	coupling�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
	regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum
	Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single
	cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable
	quantum information network using atom–nanofiber systems.},

	of bond dimension D �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
	We show that these descriptions are inequivalent in the sense that
	D �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????cannot
	be upper bounded by D only. Then we provide two constructive methods
	to obtain (ii) out of (i). The sum of squares (sos) polynomial method
	scales exponentially in the number of different eigenvalues, and
	its approximate version is formulated as a semidefinite program,
	which gives efficient approximate purifications whose D �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????only
	depends on D . The eigenbasis method scales quadratically in the
	number of eigenvalues, and its approximate version is very efficient
	for rapidly decaying distributions of eigenvalues. Our results imply
	that a description of mixed states which is both efficient and locally

	relative contributions of the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering to
	the process of four-wave mixing which reads out a spatially multimode
	state of atomic memory. We measured the temporal evolution of the
	readout fields and the spatial intensity correlations between write-in
	and readout as a function of detuning with the use of an intensified
	camera. The correlation maps enabled us to resolve between the anti-Stokes
	and the Stokes scattering and to quantify their contributions. Our
	experimental results agree quantitatively with a simple, plane-wave
	theoretical model we provide. They allow for a simple interpretation
	of the coaction of the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering at the
	readout stage. The Stokes contribution yields additional, adjustable
	gain at the readout stage, albeit with inevitable extra noise. Here
	we provide a simple and useful framework to trace it and the results
	can be utilized in the existing atomic memories setups. Furthermore,
	the shown Hamiltonian manipulation offers a broad range of atom-light

	slower byWGMs with bigger azimuthal numbers than by those with smaller
	azimuthal numbers. On the other hand, the light propagation by WGMs
	of the same azimuthal number appears to have the same speed in CROWs
	regardless of the size and the material of the resonators, indicating
	that the tail (the part of a WGM outside the resonator) determines
	inter-resonator coupling strength.},

	in a manner which, in a theoretical sense, is as effective as the
	protection of digital data from bit noise. We also discuss five general
	criteria which must be satisfied to implement a quantum computer

	by discussing our ideas for creating a quantum computer out of the

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents an overview of atom mirrors,
	resonators, waveguides, and traps that operate for the most part
	on the evanescent light-wave mechanism for atom manipulation. For
	many years, it has been known that light can be used to trap and
	manipulate small dielectric particles and atoms. In particular, the
	intense coherent light of lasers has been used to cool neutral atoms
	down to the micro-Kelvin and now even the nano-Kelvin regimes. The
	chapter discusses several convex, evanescent light-wave traps or
	guides in which at least one field is red-detuned, and hence attractive
	but a centrifugal force or a blue-detuned field provides a repulsive
	counterforce to allow the atoms to remain confined in stable orbits
	around the convex, dielectric, and optical resonator. The chapter
	focuses on the use of the evanescent field for making atom mirrors,
	resonators, waveguides, and traps. One of the principal experimental
	drawbacks of the evanescent light-wave mirror is that it requires
	quite high laser power to produce a sufficiently large potential
	barrier to reflect atoms with any realistic component of velocity
	normal to the surface, while not introducing an unacceptable degree
	of spontaneous emission probability. },

	optimum absorbing boundary condition available. However, the PML
	with the classical stretching tensor has certain limitations. Strangely,
	these limitations have rarely been addressed in elastic wave modelling.
	For example, substantial reflections occur when strong evanescent
	waves are propagating parallel to the interface. To circumvent problems
	like this, the complex frequency shifted stretching tensor has been
	introduced in electromagnetic modelling. In this paper we show that
	the convolution PML with this stretching tensor as used in electromagnetic
	modelling can be adapted for elastic wave modelling. Numerical results
	of a model where the presence of evanescent waves is predominant
	show that the PML based on the complex frequency shifted stretching
	tensor can improve the performance of the absorbing boundary layer
	considerably.},

	of a homogeneous cylindrical dielectric waveguide of arbitrary cross
	sectional shape and index n1, embedded in a medium of index n2. Both
	the weakly guiding case in which n1 $\approx$ n2 and the general
	case of arbitrary index difference are discussed theoretically. In
	both cases the approach is to derive integral representations for
	appropriate components of E and B. These satisfy the appropriate
	Helmholtz equations inside and outside the guide and also guarantee
	that the boundary conditions are satisfied. On expansion of the components
	in certain sets of basis functions, the representations become a
	set of linear equations. The vanishing of the determinant of this
	set yields the propagation constants of the various mqdes. Numerical
	results are given for weakly guiding fibers of various shapes. Among
	these are rectangles and ellipses, which make comparisons with previous
	work possible.},

	Using silver as a natural optical superlens, we demonstrated sub-diffraction-limited
	imaging with 60-nanometer half-pitch resolution, or one-sixth of
	the illumination wavelength. By proper design of the working wavelength
	and the thickness of silver that allows access to a broad spectrum
	of subwavelength features, we also showed that arbitrary nanostructures
	can be imaged with good fidelity. The optical superlens promises
	exciting avenues to nanoscale optical imaging and ultrasmall optoelectronic
	devices.},

  journal = {Computer Physics Communications },
  year = {2014},
  volume = {185},
  pages = {1697 - 1718},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {Abstract The Feynman tools have been re-designed with the goal to
	establish and implement a high-level (computer) language that is
	capable to deal with the physics of finite, n -qubit systems, from
	frequently required computations to mathematically advanced tasks
	in quantum information processing. In particular, emphasis has been
	placed to introduce a small but powerful set of keystring-driven
	commands in order to support both, symbolic and numerical computations.
	Though the current design is implemented again within the framework
	of Maple, it is general and flexible enough to be utilized and combined
	with other languages and computational environments. The present
	implementation facilitates a large number of computational tasks,
	including the definition, manipulation and parametrization of quantum
	states, the evaluation of quantum measures and quantum operations,
	the evolution of quantum noise in discrete models, quantum measurements
	and state estimation, and several others. The design is based on
	a few high-level commands, with a syntax close to the mathematical
	notation and its use in the literature, and which can be generalized
	quite readily in order to solve computational tasks at even higher
	degree of complexity. In this work, I present and discuss the (re-design
	of the) Feynman tools and make major parts of the code available
	for public use. Moreover, a few selected examples are shown and demonstrate
	possible application of this toolbox. The Feynman tools are provided
	as Maple library and can hence be used on all platforms on which
	this computer-algebra system is accessible. Program summary Program

	No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 859217
	Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Maple 15 and 16.
	Computer: Any computer capable of running the Maple package. Operating
	system: Suse and Ubuntu Linux. Typical time and memory requirements:
	Most commands respond promptly or require less than a few seconds
	on a standard processor if invoked with quantum states and registers
	of four or less qubits. In addition to the memory for using the Maple
	machinery, about 5�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????0
	\{MB\} or working memory is typically sufficient to deal with standard
	(floating-point) computations. When working with symbolic expressions
	or some large number of qubits ( n &gt; �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????5
	) , however, the requirements of cpu time and memory depend critically
	on the size and complexity of the expressions involved. Although
	Maple’s assume feature may sometimes help reduce the complexity of
	symbolic expressions, more often than not, only numerical computations
	are feasible for sizeable expressions or a larger number of qubits.
	Since most commands can be readily applied to quite different computational
	scenarios, no general scaling rule can be given for the requested
	cpu time or memory. Classification: 4.15. Nature of problem: Quantum
	information processing and quantum control require a careful preparation
	and analysis of quantum states. For such an analysis and for implementing
	new protocols, various computational tasks need to be performed frequently,
	such as the construction, manipulation and estimation of quantum
	states, the display of quantum amplitudes and probability distributions,
	the evaluation of quantum measures and quantum operations, the decomposition
	of operators into different representations, or the simulation of
	quantum measurements, to name just a few. Solution method: To support
	a large number of computational tasks in dealing with n -qubit quantum
	states and quantum registers, a high-level (computer-) language is
	designed and implemented within the framework of the computer-algebra
	system Maple. This design is based on a set of keystring-driven commands
	in order to provide a flexible, interactive and user-friendly environment
	for quantum computations on finite n -qubit systems. The present
	design provides high-level commands (procedures) that can be utilized
	in order to simulate reversible and irreversible quantum computations.
	Though the use of Maple has been found versatile to access a wealth
	of (additional) in-built mathematical functions, the re-design of
	the \{FEYNMAN\} tools is general and flexible enough to be implemented
	(or combined) with other languages and computational environments.
	Restrictions: Restrictions in the manipulation of n -qubit quantum
	states mainly arise from the complexity and stability of certain
	algebraic and numerical computations. For example, the symbolic analysis
	of noise models (as defined by means of the known Kraus operators)
	often leads to large expressions that slow down all subsequent computations.
	Owing to the exponential increase of complexity with the number of
	qubits involved, many computational tasks are limited to about 4�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
	qubits on a standard processor, although some larger number of qubits
	might become feasible by using Maple’s parallel features or some
	link to specially designed code in Matlab, C or Fortran. Unusual
	features: The \{FEYNMAN\} tools [1] have been re-designed within
	the framework of Maple to provide a small but very powerful set of
	keystring-driven commands for symbolic and numerical simulations
	of (finite) n -qubit systems. Emphasis was placed especially on establishing
	a set of (about 15�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????0)
	high-level commands that are suitable to deal with most common tasks
	from quantum information theory, and which can be applied also interactively.
	Whenever possible, both representations of quantum registers in terms
	of their state vectors and/or density matrices are equally supported
	by the program, and with no other restrictions than those given by
	the memory and processor resources of the computer. All commands
	of the \{FEYNMAN\} tools are organized in an hierarchical order and
	can be utilized as language elements in order to perform tasks at
	even higher level of complexity. Moreover, the design and syntax
	of this toolbox may serve as a model to apply computer-algebraic
	techniques to other fields in science and technology. Additional

  abstract = {The classical notions of continuity and mechanical causality are left
	in order to refor- mulate the Quantum Theory starting from two principles:
	I) the intrinsic randomness of quantum process at microphysical level,
	II) the projective representations of sym- metries of the system.
	The second principle determines the geometry and then a new logic
	for describing the history of events (Feynman's paths) that modifies
	the rules of classical probabilistic calculus. The notion of classical
	trajectory is replaced by a history of spontaneous, random an discontinuous
	events. So the theory is reduced to determin- ing the probability
	distribution for such histories according with the symmetries of
	the system. The representation of the logic in terms of amplitudes
	leads to Feynman rules and, alternatively, its representation in
	terms of projectors results in the Schwinger trace formula.},

  journal = {Contemporary Physics},
  year = {2016},
  pages = {1-19},
  abstract = { This article focuses on the general theory of open quantum systems
	in the Gaussian regime and explores a number of diverse ramifications
	and consequences of the theory. We shall first introduce the Gaussian
	framework in its full generality, including a classification of Gaussian
	(also known as ‘general-dyne�??????????????????????????????) quantum
	measurements. In doing so, we will give a compact proof for the parametrisation
	of the most general Gaussian completely positive map, which we believe
	to be missing in the existing literature. We will then move on to
	consider the linear coupling with a white noise bath, and derive
	the diffusion equations that describe the evolution of Gaussian states
	under such circumstances. Starting from these equations, we outline
	a constructive method to derive general master equations that apply
	outside the Gaussian regime. Next, we include the general-dyne monitoring
	of the environmental degrees of freedom and recover the Riccati equation
	for the conditional evolution of Gaussian states. Our derivation
	relies exclusively on the standard quantum mechanical update of the
	system state, through the evaluation of Gaussian overlaps. The parametrisation
	of the conditional dynamics we obtain is novel and, at variance with
	existing alternatives, directly ties in to physical detection schemes.
	We conclude our study with two examples of conditional dynamics that
	can be dealt with conveniently through our formalism, demonstrating
	how monitoring can suppress the noise in optical parametric processes
	as well as stabilise systems subject to diffusive scattering. },

	is predicted for increased-width membrane-type photonic crystal waveguides,
	(b) pillar-based lattices show reduced sensitivity to size fluctuations

  abstract = {Generally, the total power attenuation in multimode evanescent-field
	sensor waveguides is nonproportional to the bulk absorbance because
	the modal attenuation constants differ. Hence a direct measurement
	is difficult and is additionally aggravated because the waveguide
	absorbance is highly sensitive to the specific launching conditions
	at the waveguide input. A general asymptotic formula for the modal
	power attenuation in strongly asymmetric inhomogeneous planar waveguides
	with arbitrarily distributed weak absorption in the low-index superstrate
	is derived. Explicit expressions for typical refractive-index profiles
	are given. Except when very close to the cutoff, the predicted asymptotic
	attenuation behavior agrees well with exact calculations. The ratio
	of TM versus TE absorption has been derived to be (2 {\textminus}
	n02/nf2) for arbitrary profiles. Waveguides with a linear refractive-index
	profile show mode-independent attenuation coefficients within each
	polarization. Further, the asymptotic sensitivity is independent
	of the wavelength, so that it should be possible to directly measure
	the spectral variation of the bulk absorption. The mode independence
	of the attenuation has been verified experimentally for a second-order
	polynomial profile, which is close to a linear refractive-index distribution.
	In contrast, the attenuation in the step-profile waveguide has been
	found to depend strongly on the mode number, as predicted by theory.
	A strong spread of the modal attenuation coefficients is also predicted
	for the parabolic-profile waveguide sensor.},

	in the vicinity of a small doped semiconductor or metal nanostructure.
	Unlike in the case of control in a gas or liquid phase, the collective
	response of electrons in the nanostructure may significantly enhance
	different frequency components of the external field. This enhancement
	strongly depends on the geometry of the nanostructure and can substantially
	modify the temporal profile of the local field. The changes in the
	amplitude and phase of the local field are studied using linear response
	theory within the random phase approximation. The inverse problem
	of finding the external electromagnetic field to generate an arbitrary
	target temporal profile of the local field, including the time-dependent
	polarization of the field, is considered and solved. We systematically
	study the pulse enhancement and shape distortion effects for a set
	of control pulses of various shapes.},

	it is not possible to efficiently interface single photon emitters
	with the optical fiber platform, and there are particular challenges
	associated with the need to ensure highly efficient collection and
	delivery of emitted photons. To model single particle emission, we
	have considered the coupling of a dipole to an optical fiber mode
	as a function of orientation and position with respect to the core-cladding
	interface. Our model shows that it is possible to significantly enhance
	the collection efficiency into the guided modes as a result of modifications
	to the dipole emission pattern and power resulting from the surrounding
	fiber environment. For certain geometries the fiber-dipole coupling
	can result in a factor of 2.6 increase in the power emitted by the
	dipole.},

  abstract = {The goal of our research program is to develop competitive and sandwich
	fluoroimmunoassays with high sensitivity and fast response time,
	that do not require external reagents. Our approach to this problem
	is to employ an optical immunoassay based on total internal reflection
	fluorescence (TIRF). Specifically, monoclonal antibodies are immobilized
	on a planar waveguide. Total internal reflection of light in the
	planar waveguide sets up an evanescent field which extends about
	2000 angstroms from the interface. In the competitive immunoassay,
	a fluorescent label is coupled to a small synthetic antigen which
	is packaged with the antibody. In the absence of analyte, the fluorescently
	labeled antigen binds to the antibody and is excited by the evanescent
	field. Upon the addition of analyte, the fluorescently labeled antigen
	molecules are displaced by unlabeled antigen molecules and diffuse
	out of the evanescent field. In the sandwich assay, a primary or
	`capture' antibody is immobilized on the planar waveguide, and a
	secondary or `tracer' antibody (which is labeled with a fluorescent
	dye) is added to the bulk solution. In the absence of analyte, the
	tracer antibody remains in solution and very little fluorescence
	is observed. However, upon addition of analyte, a `molecular sandwich'
	is formed on the waveguide, composed of: (1) the capture antibody;
	(2) the analyte; and (3) the tracer antibody. Once this sandwich
	forms, the tracer antibody is within the evanescent field and fluoresces.
	Fluorescence emission is detected by a charged- coupled device (CCD).
	Using this approach, we have developed a prototype immunosensor for
	the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This device
	meets our design goals and exhibits a sensitivity of 0.1 - 1 pmolar.},

  abstract = {For the last decade it has been possible to cool atoms to microkelvin
	temperatures (~1 cm s -1 ) using a variety of optical techniques.
	Light beams provide the very strong frictional forces required to
	slow atoms from room temperature (~500 m s -1 ). However, once the
	atoms are cold, the relatively weak conservative forces of static
	electric and magnetic fields play an important role. In our group
	we have been studying the interaction of cold rubidium atoms with
	periodically magnetized data storage media. Here we review the underlying
	principles of the forces acting on atoms above a suitably magnetized
	substrate or near current-carrying wires. We also summarize the status
	of experiments. These structures can be used as smooth or corrugated
	reflectors for controlling the trajectories of cold atoms. Alternatively,
	they may be used to confine atoms to a plane, a line, or a dot and
	in some cases to reach the quantum limit of confinement. Atoms levitated
	above a magnetized surface can be guided electrostatically by wires
	deposited on the surface. The flow and interaction of atoms in such
	a structure may form the basis of a new technology, `integrated atom
	optics' which might ultimately be capable of realizing a quantum
	computer.},

	(2-D) or numerical (3-D) treatment of bent waveguides, along with
	spatial coupled mode theory (CMT) for the couplers. The required
	CMT formulation is described in detail. Also, quasi-analytical approximations
	for fast and accurate computation of the resonator spectra are discussed.
	The formalism discussed in this chapter provides valuable insight
	into the functioning of the resonators, and it is suitable for practical
	device design.},

  abstract = {Computational methods for determining the complex propagation constants
	of leaky waveguide modes have become so powerful and so readily available
	that it is possible to use these methods with little understanding
	of what they are calculating. We compare different computational
	methods for calculating the propagation constants of the leaky modes,
	focusing on the relatively simple context of a W-type slab waveguide.
	In a lossless medium with infinite transverse extent, a direct determination
	of the leaky mode by using mode matching is compared with complete
	mode decomposition. The mode matching method is analogous to the
	multipole method in two dimensions. We then compare these results
	with a simple finite-difference scheme in a transverse region with
	absorbing boundaries that is analogous to finite-difference or finite-element
	methods in two dimensions. While the physical meaning of the leaky
	modes in these different solution methods is different, they all
	predict a nearly identical evolution for an initial, nearly confined
	mode profile over a limited spatial region and a limited distance.
	Finally, we demonstrate that a waveguide that uses bandgap confinement
	with a central defect produces analogous results.},

  abstract = {Phononic crystals are the acoustic wave analogue of photonic crystals.
	Here a periodic array of scattering inclusions located in a homogeneous
	host material forbids certain ranges of acoustic frequencies from
	existence within the crystal, thus creating what are known as acoustic
	bandgaps. The majority of previously reported phononic crystal devices
	have been constructed by hand, assembling scattering inclusions in
	a viscoelastic medium, predominantly air, water or epoxy, resulting
	in large structures limited to frequencies below 1 MHz. Recently,
	phononic crystals and devices have been scaled to VHF (30-300 MHz)
	frequencies and beyond by utilizing microfabrication and micromachining
	technologies. This paper reviews recent developments in the area
	of micro-phononic crystals including design techniques, material
	considerations, microfabrication processes, characterization methods
	and reported device structures. Micro-phononic crystal devices realized
	in low-loss solid materials are emphasized along with their potential
	application in radio frequency communications and acoustic imaging
	for medical ultrasound and nondestructive testing. The reported advances
	in batch micro-phononic crystal fabrication and simplified testing
	promise not only the deployment of phononic crystals in a number
	of commercial applications but also greater experimentation on a
	wide variety of phononic crystal structures.},

	of 100 [small micro]m width and 210[small micro]m depth were fabricated
	in the optical fibers using a direct-write CO laser system. The experimental
	results show that the sensor has high sensitivity{,} able to detect
	0.005 [small micro]g L of fluorescein in the PBS solution{,} and
	the results are reproducible. The results also show that the silica
	fiber sensor has better sensitivity than that of the PMMA fiber sensor.
	This could be due to the fouling effect of the frosty layer formed
	at the microchannel made within the PMMA fiber. It is believed that
	this fiber sensor has the potential to be integrated into microfluidic
	chips for lab-on-a-chip applications.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the experimental and theoretical
	developments made in the study of optical lattices. The interference
	pattern of a set of intersecting laser beams can create a stable
	periodic potential for neutral atoms through the ac Stark shift (light
	shift), which can trap, and thereby organize atoms in an ordered,
	crystal-like structure. Historically, interest in these 鈥渙ptical
	lattices鈥� grew out of the study of laser cooling. The chapter introduces
	this subject by discussing the key one-dimensional model system for
	laser cooling and trapping in optical lattices. It discusses the
	crystallography of various lattice geometries and details the basic
	laser cooling theory in optical lattices. The chapter reviews experimental
	work that probes optical lattices through spectroscopy and discusses
	new developments made in the field, along with possible future directions.
	Aside from its role as a model system for laser cooling, the motion
	of atoms in an optical lattice is closely analogous to that of an
	electron in a solid-state crystal. This situation offers unique opportunities
	to explore phenomena that were previously accessible only in condensed
	matter. },

	of symmetries of open quantum dynamics that can be described by unitary
	operators. When the symmetries are for Hamiltonian dynamics of an

	lower bound, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian
	operator. An example shows that symmetry operators need not commute
	with the Hamiltonian operator when the spectrum of the Hamiltonian
	does not have a lower bound. There are many more symmetries that
	are only for the open dynamics of a subsystem and are described by
	unitary operators that do not commute with the Hamiltonian for the
	dynamics of the entire system. Examples show how these symmetries
	alone can reveal properties of the dynamics and reduce what needs
	to be done to work out the dynamics. A symmetry of the open dynamics
	of a subsystem can imply properties of the dynamics for the entire
	system that are not implied by the symmetries of the dynamics of
	the entire system. The symmetries are generally not related to constants
	of the motion for the open dynamics of the subsystem. There are symmetries
	of the open dynamics of a subsystem that depend only on the dynamics.
	In the simplest examples, these are also symmetries of the dynamics
	of the entire system. There are many more symmetries, of a new kind,
	that also depend on correlations, or absence of correlations, between
	the subsystem and the rest of the entire system, or on the state
	of the rest of the entire system. Symmetries that depend on correlations
	generally cannot be seen in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture as symmetries

	highly confined surface plasmon−polariton modes, termed gap plasmons.
	The spontaneous emission of an emitter placed in such a metal nanogap
	is expected to be strongly modified due to coupling to gap plasmons.
	We investigate the light emission properties of semiconductor quantum
	dots (QD) in a metal nanoslit, which is a truncated MDM waveguide.
	More specifically, we measure both the lifetime and the state of
	polarization of the out-coupled QD emission from a metal nanoslit.
	We observe clear lifetime and polarization changes of QD emission.
	As the slit width gets smaller, the QD exciton lifetime gradually
	decreases, and its emission becomes polarized normal to the slit,
	as expected for gap plasmon coupled light emission. We also find
	that the polarization of the collected QD emission is flipped (i.e.,
	becomes parallel to a slit) when the excited emitters are located
	just outside the slit. We have conducted dipole emission calculations
	in metal nanoslits, and these explain the experimentally observed
	lifetime and polarization changes well. These findings may have novel
	applications in nanoscale optical sources, sensors, and active devices.

	the light scattering among the particles. It has already been demonstrated
	that, if the intensity of the incident beam is sufficiently high,
	the scattered light is strong enough to self-arrange the objects
	in the space. Namely, the counter-propagating and incoherent Bessel
	beams are extremely useful to be employed because the interaction
	among the particles via the scattered light is not superimposed by
	other optical forces coming from the radiation pressure of each beam
	and axial gradients of the beam intensities. Therefore so-called
	optical binding between the particles is enhanced and leads to several
	stable configurations of the particles. We studied these stable configurations
	using the CDM for various properties of the beams and particles and
	we also compared these theoretical results with the experimental
	observations.},

	for time-harmonic fields and is applied to calculate the radiation
	pressure on 2-D particles modeled as infinite dielectric and magnetic
	cylinders. The force calculation results from the divergence of the
	Maxwell stress tensor and is compared favorably via examples with
	the direct application of Lorentz force to bound currents and charges.
	The application of the momentum conservation theorem is shown to
	have the advantage of less computation, reducing the surface integration
	of the Lorentz force density to a line integral of the Maxwell stress
	tensor. The Lorentz force is applied to compute the force density
	throughout the particles, which demonstrates regions of compression
	and tension within the medium. Further comparison of the two force
	calculation methods is provided by the calculation of radiation pressure
	on a magnetic particle, which has not been previously published.

	and has been much studied, but completely and provably secure schemes

	commitment that is perfectly secure. The technique involves sending

	in one of two or more directions, either along a secure channel or
	by quantum teleportation. Its security proof relies on the no-cloning

	mimic the local mode density in a simple 2D model. The inhibition

	1/e size that scales as the inverse gap bandwidth. Owing to the vertically
	guided mode structure, inhibition occurs only near the slab center,

	},
  abstract = {This paper starts with a brief review of the topic of strong and weak
	pre- and post-selected (PPS) quantum measurements, as well as weak
	values, and afterwards presents original work. In particular, we
	develop a nonperturbative theory of weak \{PPS\} measurements of
	an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter, for arbitrary initial
	states of the system and the meter. New and simple analytical formulas
	are obtained for the average and the distribution of the meter pointer
	variable. These formulas hold to all orders in the weak value. In
	the case of a mixed preselected state, in addition to the standard
	weak value, an associated weak value is required to describe weak
	\{PPS\} measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the
	generalized Aharonov–Albert–Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal
	two new regimes of weak \{PPS\} measurements: the strongly-nonlinear
	regime and the inverted region (the regime with a very large weak
	value), where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer deflection
	decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal conditions
	for weak \{PPS\} measurements are obtained in the strongly-nonlinear
	regime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is
	equal or close to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the
	measurement strength, being typically of the order of the pointer
	uncertainty. In the optimal regime, the small parameter of the theory
	is comparable to the overlap of the pre- and post-selected states.
	We show that the amplification coefficient in the weak \{PPS\} measurements
	is generally a product of two qualitatively different factors. The
	effects of the free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed.
	We also estimate the size of the ensemble required for a measurement
	and identify optimal and efficient meters for weak measurements.
	Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class of the measured
	observables. These solutions are used for numerical calculations,
	the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory
	is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement.
	We also discuss time-symmetry properties of \{PPS\} measurements
	of any strength and the relation between \{PPS\} and standard (not
	post-selected) measurements. },

  abstract = {We review the theory of the Casimir effect using scattering techniques.
	After years of theoretical effort, this formalism is now largely
	mastered so that the accuracy of theory-experiment comparisons is
	determined by the level of precision and pertinence of the description
	of experimental conditions. Due to an imperfect knowledge of the
	optical properties of real mirrors used in the experiment, the effect
	of imperfect reflection remains a source of uncertainty in theory-experiment
	comparisons. For the same reason, the temperature dependence of the
	Casimir force between dissipative mirrors remains a matter of debate.
	We also emphasize that real mirrors do not obey exactly the assumption
	of specular reflection, which is used in nearly all calculations
	of material and temperature corrections. This difficulty may be solved
	by using a more general scattering formalism accounting for non-specular
	reflection with wavevectors and field polarizations mixed. This general
	formalism has already been fruitfully used for evaluating the effect
	of roughness on the Casimir force as well as the lateral Casimir
	force appearing between corrugated surfaces. The commonly used 'proximity
	force approximation (PFA)' turns out to lead to inaccuracies in the
	description of these two effects.},

	To achieve longitudinal confinement, we propose using an integrated
	optical waveguide coupler, which provides a potential gradient along
	the beam propagation direction sufficient to confine atoms. This
	integrated optical dipole trap can support an atomic ensemble with
	a large optical depth due to its small mode area. Its quasi- TE 0
	waveguide mode has an advantage over the HE 11 mode of a nanofiber,
	with little inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening at the trapping region.
	The longitudinal confinement eliminates the need for a one dimensional
	optical lattice, reducing collisional blockaded atomic loading, potentially
	producing larger ensembles. The waveguide trap allows for scalability
	and integrability with nano-fabrication technology. We analyze the
	potential performance of such integrated atom traps.},

  volume = {151},
  pages = {239 - 250},
  abstract = {Abstract The scattering characteristics of an infinite cylinder are
	strongly influenced by the incidence angle relative to its axis.
	If the incident wave propagates in the plane normal to the axis of
	the cylinder, the polarization of the scattered wave remains unchanged
	and the scattered wave propagates in the same plan as the incident
	wave. At off-axis incidence such that the incident direction makes
	an oblique angle with the cylinder axis, the scattered wave is depolarized,
	and its spatial distribution becomes three-dimensional. This paper
	presents the scattering solution for oblique incidence on multiple
	parallel cylinders located near a planar interface by an evanescent
	wave that is generated by total internal reflection of the source
	wave propagating in the higher refractive index substrate. Hertz
	potentials are utilized to formulate the interaction of inhomogeneous
	waves with the cylinders, scattering at the substrate interface,
	and near field scattering between the cylinders. Analytic formulas
	are derived for the electromagnetic fields and Poynting vector of
	scattered radiation in the near-field and their asymptotic forms
	in the far-field. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate scattering
	of evanescent wave by multiple cylinders at off-axis incidence. },

	is one of the first platforms where all the technological components

	polaritons have already been realized. By driving the first stripline
	resonator with a microwave source and detecting the output field

	the properties of the system in the driven dissipative regime. We
	calculate the stationary polariton density and density–density correlations

	Our results display a transition from a coherent to a quantum field

  abstract = {Superconducting photon detectors have emerged as a powerful new option
	for detecting single photons. System detection efficiency that incorporates
	the quantum efficiency of the device and system losses is one of
	the most important single-photon detector performance metrics for
	quantum information applications. Superconducting transition-edge
	sensors (TESs) are microcalorimeters that have the ability of distinguishing
	single photons with negligible dark counts. In addition, TESs are
	capable of directly measuring the photon number in a pulse of light.
	We have achieved near-unity system detection efficiency with TESs
	at particular wavelengths in the near-infrared by using multilayer
	structures that enhance the absorption of light into the active device
	material. We describe the design of the multilayer structure enabling
	high detection efficiency TESs including issues and requirements
	for obtaining detection efficiency values higher than 99 %. We describe
	the device fabrication and finally, show recent results of devices
	optimized for high detection efficiency using the multilayer structure.},

  abstract = { We review the progress and main challenges in implementing large-scale
	quantum computing by optical control of electron spins in quantum
	dots (QDs). Relevant systems include self-assembled QDs of III–V
	or II–VI compound semiconductors (such as InGaAs and CdSe), monolayer
	fluctuation QDs in compound semiconductor quantum wells, and impurity
	centres in solids, such as P-donors in silicon and nitrogen-vacancy
	centres in diamond. The decoherence of the electron spin qubits is
	discussed and various schemes for countering the decoherence problem
	are reviewed. We put forward designs of local nodes consisting of
	a few qubits which can be individually addressed and controlled.
	Remotely separated local nodes are connected by photonic structures
	(microcavities and waveguides) to form a large-scale distributed
	quantum system or a quantum network. The operation of the quantum
	network consists of optical control of a single electron spin, coupling
	of two spins in a local nodes, optically controlled quantum interfacing
	between stationary spin qubits in QDs and flying photon qubits in
	waveguides, rapid initialization of spin qubits and qubit-specific
	single-shot non-demolition quantum measurement. The rapid qubit initialization
	may be realized by selectively enhancing certain entropy dumping
	channels via phonon or photon baths. The single-shot quantum measurement
	may be in situ implemented through the integrated photonic network.
	The relevance of quantum non-demolition measurement to large-scale
	quantum computation is discussed. To illustrate the feasibility and
	demand, the resources are estimated for the benchmark problem of
	factorizing 15 with Shor's algorithm. },

	with some basic aspects of random matrix theory and light propagation
	through and reflection from a random stack of dielectric slabs. Transverse
	Anderson localization of light in one- and two-dimensional coupled
	waveguide arrays is subsequently established and discussed. Recent
	experimental observations of localization and image transport in
	disordered optical fibers are discussed. More advanced topics, such
	as hyper-transport in longitudinally varying disordered waveguides,
	the impact of nonlinearity, and propagation of partially coherent
	and quantum light, are also examined.},

	limit where both the spin–spin and spin–orbit effects are important

	several aspects of the NV structure, such as ordering of the singlets
	in the ( e 2 ) electronic configuration and the spin–spin and spin–orbit
	interactions in the ( ae ) electronic configuration. We also discuss
	how the optical selection rules and the response of the center to
	electric field can be used for spin–photon entanglement schemes.
	Our general formalism is applicable to a broad class of local defects
	in solids. The present results have important implications for applications
	in quantum information science and nanomagnetometry.},

	used to measure thermal broadening of the ground state exciton homogeneous
	linewidth and energy relaxation in a single layer of interfacial
	GaAs quantum dots (QDs). We observe a nonlinear increase in the homogeneous
	linewidth with temperature from 6 to 50 K and find that a phonon
	activation term�??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? offset
	fit the data well. The absence of an activation peak in the 2D spectra
	indicates that elastic exciton–phonon scattering via virtual transitions
	between the ground and excited states significantly contributes to
	the thermal broadening. Measurements of the linewidth across the
	inhomogeneous distribution show that excitons localized in smaller
	QDs experience stronger thermal broadening. We record 2D spectra
	for a population time up to 500 ps and temperature up to 50 K to
	reveal excitonic relaxation from quantum well to QD states. As the
	temperature increases from 6 to 50 K, the relaxation time decreases
	from 180 to 30 ps, respectively. This behavior is consistent with
	a phonon-mediated scattering process.},

  abstract = {Investigations of slow and fast light effects in semiconductor waveguides
	entail interesting physics and point to a number of promising applications.
	In this review we give an overview of recent progress in the field,
	in particular focusing on the physical mechanisms of electromagnetically
	induced transparency and coherent population oscillations. While
	electromagnetically induced transparency has been the most important
	effect in realizing slowdown effects in atomic gasses, progress has
	been comparatively slow in semiconductors due to inherent problems
	of fast dephasing times and inhomogeneous broadening in quantum dots.
	The physics of electromagnetically induced transparency in semiconductors
	is discussed, emphasizing these limitations and recent suggestions
	for overcoming them. On the other hand, the mechanism of coherent
	population oscillations relies on wave mixing effects and is well
	suited for semiconductor waveguides. Recent experimental progress
	is reviewed, emphasizing new ideas that have significantly enhanced
	the degree of control that can be exercised and the frequency range
	that can be achieved. Thus, applications within microwave photonics
	appear to be within reach.},

	and tapered optical fibers has been analyzed theoretically for the
	design of an evanescent wave fiber optic immunosensor. It has been
	shown that tapered optical fibers have higher sensitivity compared
	to straight fibers. Among the tapered fibers combination tapered
	fibers were also found to have higher sensitivity than continuous
	tapered fibers. Theoretical analysis indicates that an increase in
	signal is a result of three factors, namely, V number matching, an
	increase in evanescent absorption by the fluorescent medium, and
	an increase in fluorescence emission coupling into the fiber. Maximum
	sensitivity is obtained when the radius of the fiber is reduced to
	the V number matching radius within 1 cm from the start of the taper
	with rest of the fiber remaining untapered. Also, a higher signal
	level is obtained when the launching light fills the numerical aperture
	determined by the tapering ratio of the fiber. © 1998 Society of

  abstract = {We propose a scheme involving cold atoms trapped in optical lattices
	to observe different phenomena traditionally linked to quantum-optical
	systems. The basic idea consists of connecting the trapped atomic
	state to a non-trapped state through a Raman scheme. The coupling
	between these two types of atoms (trapped and free) turns out to
	be similar to that describing light鈥�?�atter interaction within the
	rotating-wave approximation, the role of matter and photons being
	played by the trapped and free atoms, respectively. We explain in
	particular how to observe phenomena arising from the collective spontaneous
	emission of atomic and harmonic oscillator samples, such as superradiance
	and directional emission. We also show how the same setup can simulate
	Bose鈥�?�ubbard Hamiltonians with extended hopping as well as Ising
	models with long-range interactions. We believe that this system
	can be realized with state of the art technology.},

  abstract = {Abstract We construct the manifold describing the family of plane
	monochromatic light waves with all directions, polarizations, phases
	and intensities. A smooth description of polarization, valid over
	the entire sphere S 2 of directions, is given through the construction
	of an orthogonal basis pair of complex polarization vectors for each
	direction; any light beam is then uniquely and smoothly specified
	by giving its direction and two complex amplitudes. This implies
	that the space of all light beams is the six dimensional manifold
	S 2 × C 2 �??????????????????????????????????????????????? { 0 }
	, the (untwisted) Cartesian product of a sphere and a two dimensional
	complex vector space minus the origin. A Hopf map (i.e. mapping the
	two complex amplitudes to the Stokes parameters) then leads to the
	four dimensional manifold S 2 × S 2 which describes beams with all
	directions and polarization states. This product of two spheres can
	be viewed as an ordered pair of two points on a single sphere, in
	contrast to earlier work in which the same system was represented
	using Majorana’s mapping of the states of a spin one quantum system
	to an unordered pair of points on a sphere. This is a different manifold,
	C P 2 , two dimensional complex projective space, which does not
	faithfully represent the full space of all directions and polarizations.
	Following the now-standard framework, we exhibit the fibre bundle
	whose total space is the set of all light beams of non-zero intensity,
	and base space S 2 × S 2 . We give the U ( 1 ) connection which determines
	the geometric phase as the line integral of a one-form along a closed
	curve in the total space. Bases are classified as globally smooth,
	global but singular, and local, with the last type of basis being
	defined only when the curve traversed by the system is given. Existing
	as well as new formulae for the geometric phase are presented in
	this overall framework. },

  number = {9},
  abstract = {Recently, strongly modulated photonic crystals, fabricated by the
	state-of-the-art semiconductor nanofabrication process, have realized
	various novel optical properties. This paper describes the way in
	which they differ from other optical media, and clarifies what they
	can do. In particular, three important issues are considered: light
	confinement, frequency dispersion and spatial dispersion. First,
	I describe the latest status and impact of ultra-strong light confinement
	in a wavelength-cubic volume achieved in photonic crystals. Second,
	the extreme reduction in the speed of light is reported, which was
	achieved as a result of frequency dispersion management. Third, strange
	negative refraction in photonic crystals is introduced, which results
	from their unique spatial dispersion, and it is clarified how this
	leads to perfect imaging . The last two sections are devoted to applications
	of these novel properties. First, I report the fact that strong light
	confinement and huge light–matter interaction enhancement make strongly
	modulated photonic crystals promising for on-chip all-optical processing,
	and present several examples including all-optical switches/memories
	and optical logics. As a second application, it is shown that the
	strong light confinement and slow light in strongly modulated photonic
	crystals enable the adiabatic tuning of light, which leads to various
	novel ways of controlling light, such as adiabatic frequency conversion,
	efficient optomechanics systems, photon memories and photons pinning.},

  abstract = {Quantum information science addresses how uniquely quantum mechanical
	phenomena such as superposition and entanglement can enhance communication,
	information processing, and precision measurement. Photons are appealing
	for their low-noise, light-speed transmission and ease of manipulation
	using conventional optical components. However, the lack of highly
	efficient optical Kerr nonlinearities at the single photon level
	was a major obstacle. In a breakthrough, Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn
	(KLM) showed that such an efficient nonlinearity can be achieved
	using only linear optical elements, auxiliary photons, and measurement
	[Knill E, Laflamme R, Milburn GJ (2001) Nature 409:46�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????2].
	KLM proposed a heralded controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate for scalable quantum
	computation using a photonic quantum circuit to combine two such
	nonlinear elements. Here we experimentally demonstrate a KLM CNOT
	gate. We developed a stable architecture to realize the required
	four-photon network of nested multiple interferometers based on a
	displaced-Sagnac interferometer and several partially polarizing
	beamsplitters. This result confirms the first step in the original
	KLM “recipe�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????for
	all-optical quantum computation, and should be useful for on-demand
	entanglement generation and purification. Optical quantum circuits
	combining giant optical nonlinearities may find wide applications
	in quantum information processing, communication, and sensing.},

	{$\frac{1}{2}$} particles in a passive way. During this process the
	flying qubit is coherently polarized, emerging in the direction of
	the majority static spins. We conjecture that this process is reversible
	for any number of flying qubits injected sequentially in an arbitrary
	superposition state, proving this explicitly for an arbitrary state
	of one and two flying qubits. We also find a special case in which
	we are able to prove the conjecture for an arbitrary number of qubits.
	Our architecture thus has the potential to be exploited as a passive
	quantum memory to encode the flying qubits without the necessity
	of resetting between successive encoding operations. We also illustrate
	that the quantum information may be spread over many static spins
	in the memory chain, making the mechanism resistant to spin decoherence
	and other imperfections. We discuss implementing the memory system
	with trapped bosonic atoms, controlled by a spatial light modulator.},

  title = {The effects of multi-exciton interactions on optical cavity emission},
  school = {Queen's University},
  year = {2012},
  month = {July},
  abstract = {This thesis presents a theoretical study of the collective effects
	of a large number of photon emitters coupled to optical cavities.
	The ensemble effects are accounted for by considering both the light
	emitting and scattering by the photon emitters. It suggests that,
	to correctly estimate the emitters ensemble coupled cavity mode,
	it is necessary to consider the existence of the excited excitons
	ensemble and optical pumps. This thesis shows that optical pumps
	can excite more excitons and scattering channels as pumping power
	increases. The change in exciton population can lead to comprehensive
	spectral behaviors by changing the cavity spectral shapes, bandwidth
	and resonance positions, through the inhomogeneous broadening and
	frequencies repulsion effects of collective emissions. The existence
	of the exciton ensemble can also enhance optical coupling effects
	between target excitons and the cavity mode. The target exciton,
	which has a relatively large coupling strength and is close to the
	cavity peak, can affect the properties of the background dipoles
	and their coupling to the cavity. All these collective effects are
	sensitive to the number, the resonances distribution, and the optical
	properties of the background excitons in the frequency domain and
	the property of the target exciton, if any. This study provides a
	perspective on the control of the optical properties of cavities
	and individual excitons through collective excitation.},

  abstract = {This work is a theoretical investigation on the spin-polariton (polarized
	single photon) entanglement in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond
	in order to interpret the results of two landmark experiments reported
	by the teams of Buckley and Togan in Science and Nature. A Jaynes-Cummings
	model is applied to analyze the off- and on-resonant dynamics of
	the electronic spin and polarized photon system. Combined with the
	analysis on the NV center's electron structure and transition rules,
	this model consistently explained the Faraday effect, Optical Stark
	effect, pulse echo technology and energy level engineering technology
	in the way to realize the spin-polariton entanglement in diamond.
	All theoretical results are consistent well with the reported phenomena
	and data. This essay essentially aims at applying the fundamental
	skills the author has learned in Quantum Optics and Nonlinear Optics,
	especially to the interesting materials not covered in class, in
	assignments and examinations, such as calculation on matrix form
	of Hamiltonian, quantum optical dynamics with dressed state analysis,
	entanglement and so on. },

  abstract = {We study the strong coupling between photons and atoms that can be
	achieved in an optical nanofiber geometry when the interaction is
	dispersive. While the Purcell enhancement factor for spontaneous
	emission into the guided mode does not reach the strong-coupling
	regime for individual atoms, one can obtain high cooperativity for
	ensembles of a few thousand atoms due to the tight confinement of
	the guided modes and constructive interference over the entire chain
	of trapped atoms. We calculate the dyadic Green's function, which
	determines the scattering of light by atoms in the presence of the
	fiber, and thus the phase shift and polarization rotation induced
	on the guided light by the trapped atoms. The Green's function is
	related to a full Heisenberg-Langevin treatment of the dispersive
	response of the quantized field to tensor polarizable atoms. We apply
	our formalism to quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the atoms
	via polarimetry. We study shot-noise-limited detection of atom number
	for atoms in a completely mixed spin state and the squeezing of projection
	noise for atoms in clock states. Compared with squeezing of atomic
	ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features that arise
	in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity
	and polarization of the guided modes. We use a first-principles stochastic
	master equation to model the squeezing as a function of time in the
	presence of decoherence due to optical pumping. We find a peak metrological
	squeezing of �????????????????????????5 dB is achievable with current
	technology for �????????????????????????2500 atoms trapped 180 nm
	from the surface of a nanofiber with radius a=225 nm.},

  abstract = {Monochromatic energy exchanges in thin-film dielectric waveguides
	can be understood in terms of a zig-zag ray picture that includes
	Goos-Haenchen shifts that occur at the film boundaries, as pointed
	out by Burke. Recently, Kogelnik and Weber have shown that, in order
	to predict the correct modal group velocity, the ray model should
	also include the time delay associated with the ray shifts at the
	film boundaries. In this paper, we explore in detail the ray-optical
	descriptions of anisotropic film waveguides that consist of three-layered
	biaxial materials with one of the principal axes of the crystal in
	each of the three media oriented in the direction of propagation
	and the other two parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the
	film. We show that the Burke-Kogelnik-Weber (BKW) ray model provides

	lowering of the threshold pump power from a off-resonancevalue of
	37 $\mu$W to 18 $\mu$W when an individual quantum dot exciton is
	on-resonancewith the cavity mode. Photon correlation studies below
	and abovethe laser threshold confirm the single dot influence. At
	resonance weobserve antibunching with g(2)(0) $=$ 0.36 at low excitation,
	which increasesto 1 at about 1.5 times the threshold. In the off-resonant
	case, g(2)(0) is about1 below and above threshold.},

  abstract = {Quantum state reconstruction based on weak continuous measurement
	has the advantage of being fast, accurate and almost non-perturbative.
	In this work we present a pedagogical review of the protocol proposed
	by Silberfarb et al (2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 030402), whereby an
	ensemble of identically prepared systems is collectively probed and
	controlled in a time-dependent manner so as to create an informationally
	complete continuous measurement record. The measurement history is
	then inverted to determine the state at the initial time through
	a maximum-likelihood estimate. The general formalism is applied to
	the case of reconstruction of the quantum state encoded in the magnetic
	sublevels of a large-spin alkali atom, 133 Cs. We detail two different
	protocols for control. Using magnetic interactions and a quadratic
	ac Stark shift, we can reconstruct a chosen hyperfine manifold F
	, e.g. the seven-dimensional F = 3 manifold in the electronic ground
	state of Cs. We review the procedure as implemented in experiments
	(Smith et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 180403). We extend the protocol
	to the more ambitious case of reconstruction of states in the full
	16-dimensional electronic ground subspace ( F = 3�??????????????????????????????????????????????????????
	F = 4), controlled by microwaves and radio-frequency (RF) magnetic
	fields. We give detailed derivations of all physical interactions,
	approximations, numerical methods and fitting procedures, tailored
	to the realistic experimental setting. For the case of light-shift
	and magnetic control, reconstruction fidelities of ~0.95 have been
	achieved, limited primarily by inhomogeneities in the light-shift.
	For the case of microwave/RF-control we simulate fidelity >0.97,
	limited primarily by signal-to-noise.},

	and stress dependent and can be modelled in terms of the previous
	understanding of the 3 E excited state fine structure which is strain
	dependent. At room temperature the responses are largely sample and
	stress independent, and modelling involves invoking a strain independent
	excited state with a single zero field spin-level splitting of 1.42
	GHz. The change in behaviour is attributed to a temperature dependent
	averaging process over the components of the excited state orbital
	doublet. It decouples orbit and spin and at high temperature the
	spin levels become independent of any orbit splitting. One significant
	implication of this averaging is that it simplifies the development

	both the van der Waals and Casimir–Polder interaction of the atoms
	with the surface of the optical nanofibre. We compare the contributions

	basically, influenced by the van der Waals redshift and is characterized
	by a long tail on the red side of the spectrum. We conclude that
	a measurement of the lineshape of the coupled fluorescence could
	be used to characterize the strength of the interaction of atoms
	with dielectric surfaces and for the detection of atoms using nanofibres.},

	doxygen-based \{API\} manual [1] is now provided together with updated
	user guides. A largely automated, versatile new testsuite directed
	both towards computational and physics features allows for quickly
	spotting arising errors. The states of trajectories are now savable
	and recoverable with full binary precision, allowing for trajectory
	continuation regardless of evolution method (single/ensemble Monte
	Carlo wave-function or Master equation trajectory). As the main new
	feature, the framework now presents Python bindings to the highest-level
	programming interface, so that actual simulations for given composite
	quantum systems can now be performed from Python. New version program

	only on UNIX-like systems (including Mac \{OS\} X). RAM: The framework
	itself takes about 60MB, which is fully shared. The additional memory
	taken by the program which defines the actual physical system (script)
	is typically less than 1MB. The memory storing the actual data scales
	with the system dimension for state-vector manipulations, and the
	square of the dimension for density-operator manipulations. This
	might easily be GBs, and often the memory of the machine limits the
	size of the simulated system. Classification: 4.3, 4.13, 6.2. External
	routines: Boost C + + libraries, \{GNU\} Scientific Library, Blitz
	+ + , FLENS, NumPy, SciPy Catalogue identifier of previous version:
	AELU_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm.
	183 (2012) 1381 Does the new version supersede the previous version?:
	Yes Nature of problem: Definition of (open) composite quantum systems
	out of elementary building blocks [2,3]. Manipulation of such systems,
	with emphasis on dynamical simulations such as Master-equation evolution
	[4] and Monte Carlo wave-function simulation [5]. Solution method:
	Master equation, Monte Carlo wave-function method Reasons for new
	version: The new version is mainly a feature release, but it does
	correct some problems of the previous version, especially as regards
	the build system. Summary of revisions: We give an example for a
	typical Python script implementing the ring-cavity system presented
	in Sec. 3.3 of Ref. [2]: Restrictions: Total dimensionality of the
	system. Master equation—few thousands. Monte Carlo wave-function
	trajectory—several millions. Unusual features: Because of the heavy
	use of compile-time algorithms, compilation of programs written in
	the framework may take a long time and much memory (up to several
	GBs). Additional comments:�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????The
	framework is not a program, but provides and implements an application-programming
	interface for developing simulations in the indicated problem domain.
	�???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????We
	use several C + + 11 features which limits the range of supported
	compilers (g + + 4.7, clang + + 3.1) �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Documentation,

  year = {2006},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {1309},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {The extinction spectra of spherical gold nanoparticles suspended in
	a homogeneous media were measured and the results were adjusted with
	Mie's theory together with an appropriate modification of the optical
	properties of bulk material considering the limitation that introduces
	the size of nanoparticles on the dielectric function. Usually, the
	contribution of free electrons to the dielectric function is modified
	for particle size, while the contribution of bound electrons is assumed
	to be independent of size. This work discusses the separated contribution
	of free and bound electrons on the optical properties of particles
	and their variation with size for gold nanoparticles. The effects
	of dielectric function and its changes with size on extinction spectra
	near plasmon resonance are considered. The damping constant for free
	electrons was changed with size as usual and a scattering constant
	of C = 0.8 was used. For the bound electron contribution, two different
	models were analysed to fit the extinction spectra: on the one hand,
	the damping constant for interband transitions and the gap energy
	were used as fitting parameters and on the other, the electronic
	density of states in the conduction band was made size-dependent.
	For the first model, extinction spectra corresponding to particles
	with radius R = 0.7 nm were fitted using two sets of values of the
	energy gap and damping constant: Eg = 2.3 eV and \\gamma_{\\mathrm
	{b}}=158\~{}\\mathrm {meV}/\\hbar or Eg = 2.1 eV and \\gamma_{\\mathrm
	{b}}=200\~{}\\mathrm {meV}/ \\hbar . For the second model, a simple
	assumption for the electronic density of states and its contribution
	to the dielectric function in terms of size allowed to adjust extinction
	spectra for all samples explored (from 0.3 to 1.6 nm radius). This
	last model uses only one parameter, a scale factor R0 = 0.35 nm,
	that controls the contribution of the bound electrons in nanoparticles.
	Contrast between the maximum and the minimum in the extinction spectra
	near the resonance at 520 nm or alternatively the broadening of the
	plasmon band can be used to determine the size of gold nanoparticles
	with radius smaller than 2 nm.},

  abstract = {Quantum trajectory methods can be used for a wide range of open quantum
	systems to solve the master equation by unravelling the density operator
	evolution into individual stochastic trajectories in Hilbert space.
	This C++ class library offers a choice of integration algorithms
	for three important unravellings of the master equation. Different
	physical systems are modelled by different Hamiltonians and environment
	operators. The program achieves flexibility and user friendliness,
	without sacrificing execution speed, through the way it represents
	operators and states in Hilbert space. Primary operators, implemented
	in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom,
	can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product
	Hilbert spaces with arbitrary numbers of components. Standard algebraic
	notation is used to build operators and to perform arithmetic operations
	on operators and states. States can be represented in a local moving
	basis, often leading to dramatic savings of computing resources.
	The state and operator classes are very general and can be used independently
	of the quantum trajectory algorithms. Only a rudimentary knowledge
	of C++ is required to use this package. The package illustrates how
	computational physics can profit from object-oriented programming
	concepts like inheritance. },

  abstract = { Machine learning algorithms learn a desired input-output relation
	from examples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important
	for tasks such as image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation,
	with growing applications in the IT industry. In the last couple
	of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help
	to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from
	running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently
	on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into
	the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic
	overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents
	the approaches as well as technical details in an accessible way,
	and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.

	chip-based microresonator. A single reflected control photon toggles
	the switch from high reflection (R ~ 65%) to high transmission (T
	~ 90%), with an average of ~1.5 control photons per switching event
	(~3, including linear losses). No additional control fields are required.
	The control and target photons are both in-fiber and practically
	identical, making this scheme compatible with scalable architectures
	for quantum information processing.},

	the evanescent field can be controlled by the state of polarization

	information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review
	aims to summarize not just quantum computing, but the whole subject
	of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the
	most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect.
	It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of
	physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially
	information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-20th
	century. This has meant that the full significance of information
	as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This
	is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information
	and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has led
	to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world.
	Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission
	of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum
	entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation),
	the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of
	irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the
	use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum
	computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of
	quantum entanglement as a computational resource. It turns out that
	information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well.
	In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an
	introduction to classical information theory and computer science,
	including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines
	and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics
	are then outlined, and the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) experiment
	described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in
	general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum
	from classical information theory and, arguably, quantum from classical
	physics. Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including
	qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the `no cloning' property
	and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The
	universal quantum computer (QC) is described, based on the Church-Turing
	principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such
	a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period
	of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove
	that a QC of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally
	different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information,
	but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency.
	This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible
	for any device apart from a QC. To build a universal QC is well beyond
	the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum
	information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current
	experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion
	trap, high- Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods.
	These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions
	(three qubits) and should be extendable up to a thousand or more
	dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow
	the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such
	experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently
	that a practically useful QC (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually
	ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable
	coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further
	fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution
	to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC). An introduction
	to QEC is provided. The evolution of the QC is restricted to a carefully
	chosen subspace of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to
	cause a departure from this subspace. QEC provides a means to detect
	and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation.
	This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves
	quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in
	the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times. The review
	concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information
	physics and avenues for future research.},

	Importantly for realistic fabrication, our design is flexible because
	the range of parameters, cavity length and the index changes, that
	enables an ultrahigh-Q is quite broad. Furthermore as the index modification
	is post-processed, an efficient technique to generate cavities around

  abstract = {The dispersive properties of materials, i.e., their frequency-dependent
	response to the interaction with light, in most situations determines
	whether an optical process can be observed. Although one can always
	search for a specific material with the sought-after properties,
	this material might be far from optimum or might not even exist.
	Therefore, it is of great interest to develop methods that could
	tune the dispersive properties of a medium independently of the working
	frequency band. Pulses with angular dispersion, or pulse-front tilt,
	precisely allow us to achieve this goal. In this tutorial, we show
	the basics of how angular dispersion can manage to tune the dispersion
	parameters that characterize the propagation of light in a medium,
	thus permitting the observation and application of various optical
	processes in nonlinear and quantum optics that could not be realized
	otherwise. To keep the focus on first principles, the list of topics
	addressed is not exhaustive. More specifically, we consider the role
	of angular dispersion for pulse stretching and compression, broadband
	second-harmonic generation, the generation of temporal solitons in
	nonlinear $\chi$(2) media, the tunable generation of terahertz waves
	by means of optical rectification of femtosecond pulses, and the
	tuning of the frequency correlations and of the bandwidth of entangled
	paired photons.},

	modification of any linear birefringence present. These effects are
	discussed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. The activity/twist
	ratio is $\alpha$/$\tau$ $\simeq$0.13 ... 0.16 universally in weakly
	guiding silica fibers. Twisted fibers may be used as polarization
	rotators. A fiber with a {\textpm}68{\textdegree} double twist operates
	as a fast/slow mode interchanger, suitable for delay equalization.},

	results relate the resulting decay and noise terms in effective equations

	light modes to the full atomic level structure. We illustrate and
	apply our results to the case of a quantum memory protocol. Our results
	can be applied to any alkali atoms, and the general approach taken
	in this paper can be applied to light–matter interfaces and quantum
	memories based on different mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The unique capability of quantum mechanics to evolve alternative possibilities
	in parallel is appealing and over the years a number of quantum algorithms
	have been developed offering great computational benefits. Systems
	coupled to the environment lose quantum coherence quickly and realization
	of schemes based on unitarity might be impossible. Recent discovery
	of room temperature quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes
	opens up new possibilities to borrow concepts from biology to use
	quantum effects for computational purposes. While it has been conjectured
	that light harvesting complexes such as the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
	(FMO) complex in the green sulfur bacteria performs an efficient
	quantum search similar to the quantum Grover's algorithm the analogy
	has yet to be established. In this work we show that quantum dissipation
	plays an essential role in the quantum search performed in the FMO
	complex and it is fundamentally different from known algorithms.
	In the FMO complex not just the optimal level of phase breaking is
	present to avoid both quantum localization and Zeno trapping but
	it can harness quantum dissipation as well to speed the process even
	further up. With detailed quantum calculations taking into account
	both phase breaking and quantum dissipation we show that the design
	of the FMO complex has been evolutionarily optimized and works faster
	than pure quantum or classical-stochastic algorithms. Inspired by
	the findings we introduce a new computational concept based on decoherent
	quantum evolution. While it is inspired by light harvesting systems,
	the new computational devices can also be realized on different material
	basis opening new magnitude scales for miniaturization and speed.},

  abstract = {A novel method of generation and synthesis of azimuthally E-polarized
	vortex beams is presented. Along the beam axis such beams have a
	strong longitudinally polarized magnetic field where ideally there
	is no electric field. We show how these beams can be constructed
	through the interference of Laguerre\&\#x2013;Gaussian beams carrying
	orbital angular momentum (OAM), and then quantify the longitudinal
	magnetic field of such beams. As an example, we present a metasurface
	made of double-split ring slot pairs and report a good agreement
	between simulated and analytical results. Both a high magnetic-to-electric-field
	contrast ratio and a magnetic field enhancement are achieved. We
	also investigate the metasurface physical constraints to convert
	a linearly polarized beam into an azimuthally E-polarized beam and
	characterize the performance of magnetic field enhancement and electric
	field suppression of a realistic metasurface. These findings are
	potentially useful for novel optical spectroscopy related to magnetic
	dipolar transitions and for optical manipulation of particles with
	spin and OAM.},

  abstract = {C++QED is a versatile framework for simulating open quantum dynamics.
	It allows to build arbitrarily complex quantum systems from elementary
	free subsystems and interactions, and simulate their time evolution
	with the available time-evolution drivers. Through this framework,
	we introduce a design which should be generic for high-level representations
	of composite quantum systems. It relies heavily on the object-oriented
	and generic programming paradigms on one hand, and on the other hand,
	compile-time algorithms, in particular C++ template-metaprogramming
	techniques. The core of the design is the data structure which represents
	the state vectors of composite quantum systems. This data structure
	models the multi-array concept. The use of template metaprogramming
	is not only crucial to the design, but with its use all computations
	pertaining to the layout of the simulated system can be shifted to
	compile time, hence cutting on runtime. Program summary Program title:

	Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: i386–i686,
	x86_64 Operating system: In principle cross-platform, as yet tested
	only on UNIX-like systems (including Mac \{OS\} X). RAM: The framework
	itself takes about 60 MB, which is fully shared. The additional memory
	taken by the program which defines the actual physical system (script)
	is typically less than 1 MB. The memory storing the actual data scales
	with the system dimension for state-vector manipulations, and the
	square of the dimension for density-operator manipulations. This
	might easily be GBs, and often the memory of the machine limits the
	size of the simulated system. Classification: 4.3, 4.13, 6.2, 20
	External routines: Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org/), \{GNU\}
	Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), Blitz++ (http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/),
	Linear Algebra Package �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Flexible
	Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions (http://flens.sourceforge.net/).
	Nature of problem: Definition of (open) composite quantum systems
	out of elementary building blocks [1]. Manipulation of such systems,
	with emphasis on dynamical simulations such as Master-equation evolution
	[2] and Monte Carlo wave-function simulation [3]. Solution method:
	Master equation, Monte Carlo wave-function method. Restrictions:
	Total dimensionality of the system. Master equation �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????few
	thousands. Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory �???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????several
	millions. Unusual features: Because of the heavy use of compile-time
	algorithms, compilation of programs written in the framework may
	take a long time and much memory (up to several GBs). Additional
	comments: The framework is not a program, but provides and implements
	an application-programming interface for developing simulations in
	the indicated problem domain. Supplementary information: http://cppqed.sourceforge.net/.
	Running time: Depending on the magnitude of the problem, can vary
	from a few seconds to weeks. References:[1] A. Vukics, H. Ritsch,

	The as-deposited SRO film was found to be a single phase SiO1.0,
	as suggested by its electronic structure characteristics determined
	by the valence electron energy loss spectrum. This single phase undergoes
	a continuous but incomplete phase decomposition to Si and SiO2 for
	films annealed between 300 and 1100°C. The resulting Si phase first
	appears as �??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? nm-diameter
	amorphous clusters which grow to larger sizes at higher annealing
	temperatures, but only crystallize at a critical temperature between
	800 and 900°C. This cluster/matrix configuration of the SRO films
	is consistent with the appearance of the interface plasmon and its
	oscillator strength as a function of the nanoparticle size. Three
	separate stages were identified in the sequence of annealed films
	that were characterized by the presence of single-phase SiO, amorphous
	silicon nanoclusters, and silicon nanocrystals, respectively. The
	presence of amorphous silicon nanoclusters in the intermediate stage,
	the mean size of which can be controlled via annealing, may offer
	an alternative to silicon nanocrystal composites for optical applications.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT An understanding of the oscillations of differentially rotating
	systems is key to many areas of astrophysics. It is of particular
	relevance to the emission of gravitational waves from oscillating
	neutron stars, which are expected to possess significant differential
	rotation immediately after birth or binary merger. In a previous
	paper we analysed the normal modes of a simple system exhibiting
	differential rotation. In this complementary paper we address the
	initial-value problem for the same simple model using both analytical
	methods and numerical time-evolutions. We derive a necessary and
	sufficient condition for dynamical shear instability. We discuss
	the dynamical behaviour of the continuous spectrum in response to
	an initial perturbation, and show that certain singular solutions
	within the continuous spectrum appear physically indistinguishable
	from the discrete modes outside the continuous spectrum.},

	The dispersion relation, group velocity and GVD are found numerically

	fast and slow transmission of light. Zero group velocity is present
	at the ends of the Brillouin zone, but also in other parts of it.
	Infinite and finite SC-CROW structures show band gaps created by
	Bragg and ring resonances. Pulse propagation at slow group velocities
	is highly dispersive, but easier to manage at higher group velocities.
	The differences between SC-CROW, SCISSOR and CROW waveguides are
	studied in detail.},

  abstract = {We address two issues in the quantum electrodynamical description
	of photonic media with some disorder, neglecting material dispersion.
	When choosing a gauge in which the static potential vanishes, the
	normal modes of the medium with disorder satisfy a different transversality
	condition than the modes of the ideal medium. Our first result is
	an integral equation for optical modes such that all perturbation-theory
	solutions by construction satisfy the desired transversality condition.
	Secondly, when expanding the vector potential for the medium with
	disorder in terms of the normal modes of the ideal structure, we
	find the gauge transformation that conveniently makes the static
	potential zero, thereby generalizing work by Glauber and Lewenstein
	(1991) [15]. Our results are relevant for the quantum optics of disordered
	photonic crystals.},

	in one of the degenerate ground states a single photon introduced
	into the driven cavity mode will be recycled to pump multiple atoms
	to the other ground state. For two atoms we analytically calculate
	the steady state using quantum trajectory equations and show that
	the system makes stochastic transitions between two different subspaces
	with the transition correlated with the emission of a polarized photon
	from one of the two modes of the cavity. In this way the long time
	evolution of the atomic state can be monitored by direct photodetection
	of the cavity decay passed through a polarizing beam splitter. We
	also investigate the dynamics of the approach to the steady state
	by numerical simulations carried out using the Quantum Toolbox in

	polystyrene particles on a prism surface. Since the radiation pressure
	transferred laterally from the evanescent wave is negated on both
	sides, particles can be stably aligned. By projecting a circular
	and a linear beam spot onto the interface, both multiple and single
	arrays of particles are achieved. Arrays of particles trapped on
	the interface can be easily moved adjusting the intensity of incident
	beams on either side. We also simulate electromagnetic distribution
	of scattering light that is converted from the evanescent wave using
	the FDTD method. The results show that scattering light converts
	from an evanescent wave propagating through a particle array and
	has a distance longer than that propagating from a normal evanescent
	wave.},

  abstract = {A tapered optical nanofiber is simultaneously used to trap and optically
	interface cold atoms through evanescent fields and constitutes a
	new and well controllable hybrid quantum system. The atoms are trapped
	in two parallel one dimensional (1D) optical lattices generated by
	suitable far blue and red detuned evanescent field modes very close
	to opposite sides of the nanofiber surface. Collective electronic
	excitations (excitons) of each of the optical lattices are resonantly
	coupled to the second lattice forming symmetric and antisymmetric
	common excitons. In contrast to the inverse cube dependence of the
	individual atomic dipole–dipole interaction, we analytically find
	an exponentially decaying coupling strength with distance between
	the lattices. The resulting symmetric (bright) excitons strongly
	interact with the resonant nanofiber photons to form fiber polaritons,
	which can be observed through linear optical spectra. For large enough
	wave vectors, the polariton decay rate to free space is strongly
	reduced, which should render this system ideal for the realization
	of long-range quantum communication between atomic ensembles.},
